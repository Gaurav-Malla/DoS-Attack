# DoS-Attack
Simulated and mitigated Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, including SYN Flood and ICMP Floo,d in a virtual lab environment using Kali Linux and Metasploitable. Demonstrated scanning with Nmap, attacks with Hping3, and applied defensive measures like iptables, SYN cookies, and Fail2Ban.
## Features
- Reconnaissance using Nmap
- SYN and ICMP flood attacks with Hping3
- Spoofed IP scanning and attack simulation
- Traffic analysis via Wireshark
- Defensive configurations including:
  - ICMP blocking
  - SYN cookies
  - iptables rate limiting
  - Fail2Ban banning
  - NGINX reverse proxy

## Technologies Used
- Kali Linux
- Metasploitable 2
- Hping3
- Nmap
- Wireshark
- iptables, sysctl, Fail2Ban, NGINX
